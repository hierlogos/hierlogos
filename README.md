## Hi, I'm Laisvis ⚖️

My journey into data is fueled by a desire to blend analytical rigor with creative insight. With a **1st Class Degree** in Business with Accounting and a background in photography & digital content creation, I offer a unique perspective on problem-solving and data interpretation. I found myself really drawn to how data can help create better strategies and give us a clearer view of things, and that's what led me to change my career focus.

I am now actively pursuing opportunities in the data domain and am excited to contribute to impactful projects. My focus is on continuous learning and applying my skills to real-world challenges.
